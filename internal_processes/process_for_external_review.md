# Skeleton process for external PRs
You can use this process to handle any incoming external pull requests.

- Who sees an external PR talks to other team member to find out who wants to be assigned to the PR.
- The assigned person assigns themself on GitHub and writes a quick reply/comment that we are having a look at the PR.
- Check how and if the PR fits to our own timeline (maybe talk to product/design)
- Review the PR:
  - Evaluate the same aspects as for any intern PR
  - Additionally pay attention to any potential security issues that might be introduce
  - Check any new libraries that are added
  - Check for any possible copyright problems (GoogleSearch? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)
  - Post your review and follow our general PR process
  - Possible important questions to answer before merging the changes:
    - Are we legally allowed to use the code (because of our contract with ministry)
    - Are the contributions and licenses used okay?
