# Code of conduct violation process
In case someone notices a violation of the code of conduct (CoC) of the open source repository of the Steuerlotse, they can use our report channels (s. PoC below) to contact us. Please refer to the CoC and this document when resolving the issue.

## Communication process
In general:
- Have a look into what has happened
- Contact anyone involved in private
- Have a look into our code of conducts
- Try to find a solution that works for everyone but also follow our rules for handling misbehaving members

## Point of Contact
We have two mails:
- internal projects mail (the ADD_YOUR_MAIL@YOUR_SERVICE.de in the code of conduct)
- the genral hallo@digitalservice.bund.de mail (⚠️ **make sure to talk to the responsible people and inform them when using that email in your code of conduct**)

The first is the general contact possibility and is handled by us. The second mail is handled by the internal DigitalService team and should only be used by community members for any problem related to our open source team handling the general mail. 
For this we have two internal point of contacts:
- Person A: For any general reports coming in through hallo@digitalservice.bund.de. 
- Person B: For any reports coming in which are related to person A.

If there are any reports concerning person A & B at the same time, the internal DigitalService team should inform the project team and the team will decide how to handle those according to the circumstances.
